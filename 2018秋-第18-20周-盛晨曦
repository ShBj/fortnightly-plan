I have used Python to make some forms,and learned some algorithms like "if" and "for...in",and some forms of "dictionary".To make things better,I mixed my own creativity in it.
However,soon,my final exam will start,so I will have to cease learning in the next period.To make my GPA higher,I have to recite and memory Politics,English and Inorganic Chemistry better.Pardon!
